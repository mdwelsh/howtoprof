Congratulations! You found my [Physical Web beacon](https://google.github.io/physical-web/).
This is a little wireless device that I keep in my bag, which periodically beacons out the
URL of this page on a low-power Bluetooth channel. Your phone picked up this signal and sent
you to this page, which as you can tell is pretty exciting.

While you're here, check out [my blog](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com).
