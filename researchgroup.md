title: Building and managing a research group
layout: page

Being a professor is a lot like founding your own startup. You're responsible for [raising money](/funding),
recruiting students, setting the vision, and managing the group. (Not to mention all the other stuff you have
to do, like [teaching](/teaching) and [committee work](/service) and everything else.) The sooner you realize
that a big part of your job is "management", the sooner you'll be able to draw on resources to help you succeed
in this role.

# Some books to read

Yes! Books! You know, those things with paper in them that they used to sell at these things called "book stores",
before Amazon put them all out of business?

Most of these books have nothing to do with being a prof, at least on the surface. But managing a group of grad
students is the same as managing a group of employees at a company. There is much to learn from the literature on
management. Personally, I never had much taste for reading the likes of Lee Iacocca or Andy Grove, but these
people know a hell of a lot about building and managing teams.
