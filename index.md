This is the missing manual for professors, curated by [Matt Welsh](http://www.mdw.la/).

# What's all this, then?

Being a professor is one of the hardest and most complicated jobs in the world. Yet, there's no good place to learn how to do the job, and how to do the job well. Most profs have to figure it out as they go, and it can be a real trial by fire.

I thought it would be nice if there were a handbook for new professors, kind of a one-stop-shop for learning how to do the job. This site collects writings, from myself and others, on how to be a professor. It's open source and I welcome contributions. The focus is on being a professor in Computer Science, but most of the material will apply to faculty in other science and engineering fields. Professors in more distant areas may or may not find this of much use.
